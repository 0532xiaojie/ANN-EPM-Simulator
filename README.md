## Environment
### Elevated Plus Maze
A test measuring anxiety in laboratory animals that usually uses rodents as a screening test for putative anxiolytic or anxiogenic compounds and as a general research tool in neurobiological anxiety research such as PTSD and TBI.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_plus_maze)

### Webots
Webots is a professional robot simulator widely used for educational purposes.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webots)

## Machine Learning
### Artificial Neural Network
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) or connectionist systems are a computational model used in computer science and other research disciplines, which is based on a large collection of simple neural units (artificial neurons), loosely analogous to the observed behavior of a biological brain's axons. Each neural unit is connected with many others, and links can enhance or inhibit the activation state of adjoining neural units. Each individual neural unit computes using summation function. There may be a threshold function or limiting function on each connection and on the unit itself, such that the signal must surpass the limit before propagating to other neurons. These systems are self-learning and trained, rather than explicitly programmed, and excel in areas where the solution or feature detection is difficult to express in a traditional computer program.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)

### Genetic Algorithm
A genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on bio-inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm)
